### Josi Kieling's photo portfolio webpage

http://www.jkieling.com

This is the code for Josi Kieling's official website, currently under implementation. Josi Kieling is a rock enthusiast and photographer based in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

The website contains two main sections, a homepage built using vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript and a photo portfolio built using React.js and React Router (jkieling.com/galleries). I have decided to use React for the photo portfolio because, as more tools and functionalities are added, a modular, easily scalable, component-based approach appears to be more suitable.
